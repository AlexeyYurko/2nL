/* what I want to see (not in order of priority):
 Logo
 game/settings selection
 icons for pause / new game (reload) / settings / colour shift instead of text boxes
 player name input after losing
 game centre integration
 move away from sprites (sprites are fine, but what about screen resolutions?)
 add music (irrelevant)
 make normal controls - now move very uncomfortable, "torn" constantly
 code should be adjusted to the guides
 add a local scoreboard
 introduce a gradation of complexity (shapes/colours) - linear or in waves
